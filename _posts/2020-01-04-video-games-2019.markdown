<h4 style="margin:0;">7 Billion Humans</h4>
*iOS*<br/>

This single player puzzle game is essentially the sequel to [Human Resource Machine which I chronicled last year](/posts/video-games-2018). This time, instead of assembly, you're tasked with multi-threading puzzles! As the levels progress you get more commands at your disposal. Puzzles get more and more difficult and gnarly as you progress. Each puzzle includes some stretch goals like fewest number of commands. Tricky, fun puzzler! Like Human Resource Machine, I played it on my phone, which was made the UI a little tight. 


<h4 style="margin:0;">Civilization VI</h4>
*PC Steam*<br/>

It's Civ. Same solid game. For some reason, I haven't been able to get into the recent ones as much as the older ones when I was a kid. I don't know if it's because they're more complicated, or if they're generally the same. 

<h4 style="margin:0;">Worms WMD</h4>
*Nintendo Switch*<br/>

Basically a refresh of the classic 2D Worms games for the Switch. In this turn-based game, each player controls a team of worms that try to annihilate each other! Controls are still kind of awkward, but once you get the hang of it, it's a fun game for a small groups. Contrary to the opinions of my family, I think 2D Worms is vastly superior to 3D Worms.


<h4 style="margin:0;">Life is Strange</h4>
*PC Steam*<br/>

Your character, Max, is a senior in high school, and she mysteriously gained the ability to roll back time and change her decisions and interactions. It deals with some heavy topics like bullying, death, love, friendship which might not make it a great kick-back-and-relax type game for some. However, this is one of the most emotionally impactful games I've ever played. I read that Max was supposed to be a neutral character so you're more likely to attribute personal characteristics to her. Well, I fell for this hook, line, and sinker. Her, and some of the other characters reminded me strongly of high school, so I really bought in to it. It gave me a heavy sense of nostalgia, gratitude, and melancholy. 

<h4 style="margin:0;">Baba Is You</h4>
*Nintendo Switch*<br/>

This is a damn clever puzzler where you manipulate the rules of the level to complete the objective of the puzzle. It's tricky to explain. Some are straightforward, but others took me a long time. My wife would catch me just staring at the screen, not moving, deep in thought, trying to solve the puzzles. I loved this game.

<h4 style="margin:0;">Borderlands 3</h4>
*PC Epic Games*<br/>

I haven't gotten to far into Borderlands, but it's essentially the same zany, irreverent first person shooter as its predecessor. New characters, new guns, new worlds, new enemies, new ridiculous quests (I killed a bunch of bad guys to get a coffee mug), and still very fun.

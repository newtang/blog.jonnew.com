## Fiction

#### [![Artemis]({{ site.url }}/assets/books-2018/artemis.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px"}](http://a.co/g8Cm66b)[Artemis](http://a.co/6TpDdcj) by Andy Weir
The author of The Martian is back with another fun space adventure, this time on a moon base. Artemis has a lot of fascinating science factoids that The Martian has, and I though the story was gripping, particularly through the end. I had a tough time visualizing some of the things described to me, but all in all this was a fun read.


## Non-fiction

#### [![The Cartoon Guide to Statistics]({{ site.url }}/assets/books-2018/cartoonstats.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px"}](http://a.co/2qb8uBD)[The Cartoon Guide to Statistics](http://a.co/6TpDdcj) by Larry Gonick & Woollcott Smith
I seem to try to learn a little more about statistics every year, and this book is my latest attempt. There's lots of good examples that build on the lessons of previous chapters. Admittedly at times it went a little too fast for me, and I had to repeatedly go back and refresh myself. But overall, this was pretty good. I'm happy to have a book I can revisit to refresh myself on statistics concepts.

#### [![Soonish]({{ site.url }}/assets/books-2018/soonish.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px"}](http://a.co/eqiqITR)[Soonish](http://a.co/eqiqITR) by Kelly Weinersmith and Zach Weinersmith
This is probably the most fun non-fiction book I've read in years. The authors go through several upcoming technologies and document the possibilities for world improvement/doom and how far away they might be. One of the authors is the creator of the excellent [Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal](https://www.smbc-comics.com/) comic, and his humor (and comics) shines throughout the book.

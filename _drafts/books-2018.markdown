## Fiction

#### [![Artemis]({{ site.url }}/assets/books-2018/artemis.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px"}](http://a.co/g8Cm66b)[Artemis](http://a.co/6TpDdcj) by Andy Weir
The author of The Martian is back with another fun space adventure, this time on a moon base. Artemis has a lot of fascinating science factoids that The Martian has, and I though the story was gripping, particularly through the end. I had a tough time visualizing some of the things described to me, but all in all this was a fun read.

#### [![Pirate Latitudes]({{ site.url }}/assets/books-2018/pirateLatitudes.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px"}](http://a.co/f8VGzjp)[Pirate Latitudes](http://a.co/f8VGzjp) by Michael Crichton
I read most of Crichton's books as a teenager. I was a huge fan, but it's been years since I've read anything by him. There have been a few books that have been released posthumously, one of which was Pirate Latitudes. It starts a bit slow, but really picks up. It feels like Oceans 11 in the 1600s with Pirates, then goes in several different directions. Really fun book.

## Non-fiction

#### [![The Cartoon Guide to Statistics]({{ site.url }}/assets/books-2018/cartoonstats.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px"}](http://a.co/2qb8uBD)[The Cartoon Guide to Statistics](http://a.co/6TpDdcj) by Larry Gonick & Woollcott Smith
I seem to try to learn a little more about statistics every year, and this book is my latest attempt. There's lots of good examples that build on the lessons of previous chapters. Admittedly at times it went a little too fast for me, and I had to repeatedly go back and refresh myself. But overall, this was pretty good. I'm happy to have a book I can revisit to refresh myself on statistics concepts.

#### [![Soonish]({{ site.url }}/assets/books-2018/soonish.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px"}](http://a.co/eqiqITR)[Soonish](http://a.co/eqiqITR) by Kelly Weinersmith and Zach Weinersmith
This is probably the most fun non-fiction book I've read in years. The authors go through several upcoming technologies and document the possibilities for world improvement/doom and how far away they might be. One of the authors is the creator of the excellent [Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal](https://www.smbc-comics.com/) comic, and his humor (and comics) shines throughout the book.

#### [![The Charisma Myth]({{ site.url }}/assets/books-2018/charismaMyth.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px"}](http://a.co/6ZQETgC )[Charisma Myth](http://a.co/6ZQETgC) by Olivia Fox Cabane
This book's primary argument is in the subtitle, "anyone can master the art and science of personal magnetism". I agree with the premise; the book has some interesting points and gave several suggestions on how to improve charisma. A lot of it came down to listening intently, expressing sincere empathy, and maintaining positive body language. So, while I think there were some valid suggestions, I didn't love this book. It seemed too long, felt repetitive, and had a weird pseudo-sciencey self-help vibe. It's worth a skim or a quick look at the summaries though.

#### [![The Case Against Sugar]({{ site.url }}/assets/books-2018/caseAgainstSugar.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px"}](http://a.co/0neCK1c)[The Case Against Sugar](http://a.co/0neCK1c) by Gary Taubes
This is kind of a lengthy history on sugar, it's introduction into "Western diets" and the work that the sugar industry has done to persuade the public that sugar is harmless. It also goes into detail about the real harm that extensive sugar consumption leads to. The book made it's point, but overall, I thought it was a bit slow; it focused more on the politics, and less on the biology and science. The most interesting part was the correlation between sugar consumption and a variety of diseases including gout, cancer, and Alzheimers. Side note: I wrote about [reducing my carbohydrate intake in an earlier post]({{site.url}}/posts/losing-weight-by-giving-up-carbohydrates).

####[![Astrophysics for People in a Hurry]({{ site.url }}/assets/books-2018/astrophysics.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px"}](http://a.co/chn4bUU)[Astrophysics for People in a Hurry](http://a.co/chn4bUU) by Neil de Grasse Tyson
Very fun, very informative read. Pretty light as far as non-fiction goes. I really enjoyed the sections on Dark Matter and Dark Energy.

####[![The God Delusion]({{ site.url }}/assets/books-2018/godDelusion.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px"}](http://a.co/4uCUaUQ)[The God Delusion](http://a.co/4uCUaUQ) by Richard Dawkins
I've been curious about this book for awhile. Dawkins makes a lot of interesting points about the Bible, particularly some history and contradictions. It's a bit slow, but I think I read too many nonfiction books in a row. I enjoyed his discussions on evolution and memetics.

Most of my game playing time this year was spent on Borderlands 3 and Baba Is You which [I covered in last year's post](/posts/video-games-2019).

Imagine you could golf... anything? Very fun, very silly "golf" game that occasionally has some tough challenges. Manages to parody a bunch of games in a golfy way. I don't think that sentence has been written before. Includes a fun two-player mode!

<h4 style="margin:0;">Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime</h4>

Fun couch co-op game that's a few years old at this point. Up to four players control different aspects of a spaceship; steering, guns, shield in order to shoot bad guys and rescue, what else, space bunnies. It's sorta like Overcooked In Space.

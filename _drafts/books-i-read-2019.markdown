## Fiction

#### [![Girl on the Train]({{ site.url }}/assets/books-2019/girlOnTrain.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px"}](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1594634025/)[Girl on the Train](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1594634025/) by Paula Hawkins
Even though this was a best-seller, I'm not really sure what to think of this book. It was a breeze to read through, the structure of the characters' perspectives was clever, and it had me guessing until the end. However, I occasionally found the characters actions frustrating and annoying, which clouded my enjoyment of the book (and is probably an indictment on my lack of empathy). 


## Non-fiction

#### [![How To Invent Everything]({{ site.url }}/assets/books-2019/howToInventEverything.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px"}](https://www.amazon.com/dp/073522014X/)[How To Invent Everything]( https://www.amazon.com/dp/073522014X/) by Ryan North
By the creator of [Dinosaur Comics](https://www.qwantz.com/), the premise of this book is that you used a time machine to go back in time and you broke down with no way to return. This book serves as a guide for rebuilding modern civilization, or How To Invent Everything. I loved this book. There are lots of fascinating histories on inventions and how they frequently took embarrassingly long for humanity to come up with them. And the book delivers it with abundant humor. It's like if Douglas Adams wrote an anthropology book. Great read!

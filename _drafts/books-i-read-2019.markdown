## Fiction

#### [![Girl on the Train]({{ site.url }}/assets/books-2019/girlOnTrain.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px"}](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1594634025/)[Girl on the Train](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1594634025/) by Paula Hawkins
Even though this was a best-seller, I'm not really sure what to think of this book. It was a breeze to read through, the structure of the characters' perspectives was clever, and it had me guessing until the end. However, I occasionally found the characters actions frustrating and annoying, which clouded my enjoyment of the book.

11/22/63 by Stephen King
It's been awhile since I read a Stephen King book. He paints a realistic picture, realistic characters, gradually and methodically advancing the plot. I really liked it.

The Fifth Season by N.K. Jemisen. 
This book kind of throws you in a complicated world of jargon where you're not quite sure what is going on. But, patience pays off! The world and characters are fascinating. My favorite fiction book of the year.



## Non-fiction

#### [![How To Invent Everything]({{ site.url }}/assets/books-2019/howToInventEverything.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px"}](https://www.amazon.com/dp/073522014X/)[How To Invent Everything]( https://www.amazon.com/dp/073522014X/) by Ryan North
By the creator of [Dinosaur Comics](https://www.qwantz.com/), the premise of this book is that you used a time machine to go back in time and you broke down with no way to return. This book serves as a guide for rebuilding modern civilization, or How To Invent Everything. I loved this book. There are lots of fascinating histories on inventions and how they frequently took embarrassingly long for humanity to come up with them. And the book delivers it with abundant humor. It's like if Douglas Adams wrote an anthropology book. Great read!


#### [![The Death and Life of Great American Cities]({{ site.url }}/assets/books-2019/deathAndLifeCities.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px"}](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006XEAHO6/)[The Life and Death of Cities]( https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006XEAHO6/) by Jane Jacobs
I really wanted to like this. I've been getting more interested in urbanism lately, and this is supposed to be a great urbanist book even though it's 50 years old. I couldn't get into it. It's dense, and it's a lot of anecdotal heresay. I started to lose interest a quarter of the way through the author was critical of having parks.  Just not for me.

The Food Lab: Better Home Cooking Through Science by J. Kenji Lopez-Alt
This is not a book I read end-to-end, because this is mostly a cookbook! However, it includes a lot of science of cooking which is fascinating. It also dives into often excluded basics like scrambled eggs. Yes, I knew how to scramble eggs before I read this, but Lopez-Alt dives deep into how to do fluffy eggs vs creamy eggs, and how exactly it works. My scrambled eggs are fluffier than they've ever been!

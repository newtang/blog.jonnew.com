No on Measure Y

Cities need the freedom to grow (and shrink) to fit their changing needs and demographics. Artificially limiting the growth of a city with onerous height and density limits have insidious side effects, particularly for a desirable city like San Mateo. As housing or office demand increases and the supply cannot keep up, prices go up. We've already seen the corrolary take place; supply increased in San Francisco as some residents left the area, lowering prices. When the prices increase, the most affected are the most vulnerable, and they're pushed farther, and farther away.

The Bay Area has the highest percentage of supercommuters, those who travel more than 90 minutes each way, in the country. By pushing more people out, we've incrased their risk to wildfires, increased the amount of driving necessary to commute, increased congestion, and emitting more carbon. There is an astonishingly low percentage of San Mateo firefighters, police officers (however you feel about them) that actually live in the area because it is too expensive.

Voting No on Y gives us the freedom to increase density where it's needed most, near transit, and the ability to start restoring our jobs/homes imbalance. As someone who is lucky enough to be able to walk to parks, grocery stores, and restaurants, living within 15 minutes of amenities is a blessing. When you live next to a grocery store, you don't need to drive the grocery store. Sharing this blessing with more people makes towns more resilient, improves lives, and helps the environment.

A common retort is that if we build more, won't it just fill up with wealthy tech folks? There will of course, be some. Like I said, San Mateo is a desirable area to live. But not only will complexes continue to an affordable housing component (citation), they're likely coming from other nearby places, opening up more housing close by.

Density is not the reason for spread of Covid-19. Tokyo and Singapore, two of the densest cities in the world, have managed to keep cases very low. Los Angeles has a significantly higher spread of Covid than San Francisco, while being significantly less dense. https://furmancenter.org/thestoop/entry/covid-19-cases-in-new-york-city-a-neighborhood-level-analysis

As I mentioned in an [earlier post](/posts/interview-prep), I had on-site interviews at a few places this year. All the companies offered a tour and lunch, but a few places offered a few extra perks I wanted to highlight.

Before the interview, [Stripe](https://stripe.com) and [Square](https://squareup.com) gave me email addresses for various groups within the company like LGBT, parents, and various ethnic groups, allowing me to ask questions to any groups I may have identified with.

Square gifted me a homemade candle from one of their merchants.

Stripe offered to pay for my transportation to and from the interview. I'm a little surprised more places don't do this.

I didn't interview at [Airtable](https://airtable.com), but they gave me an Amazon gift card for completing their take home test, which I appreciated.

[Mapbox](https://mapbox.com) gave me a handwritten card, thanking me for coming in.

Even though it might be logistically tricky, I think more companies should offer to pay for transit for the interview. I assume most won't take it, but it's worth eliminating any potential barriers that would dissuade the candidate from interviewing. Additionally, the list of groups to email is a nice touch. I personally didn't take advantage of it, but it's easy to see how it would be beneficial.

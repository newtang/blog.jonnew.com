The Three Body Problem by Cixin Liu
  - starts a little slow
  - very creative ideas
  - doesn't go in a direction I expected, but it's a very compelling read.

Without Their Permission by Alexis Ohanian
 - fun read, but not a ton of actionable learning items in it.
 - but it's inspiring to get to work and build something.

Delivering Happiness by Tony Hsieh
 - Pretty interesting story about Hsieh's life and decision making
 - Really enjoyed the discussion about how company culture is an extension of brand
 - I still can't believe he walked away from $40 million. He just had to continue working at LinkExchange for a year and he couldn't do it! 
 - Very end touches upon the science of happiness. This correlated well with Drive which talked about purpose, autonomy, and mastery. Delivering Happiness added Connectedness which I really like.

Scalable Internet Architectures by Theo Schlossnagle
- I didn't like this very much. It bounced between topics I knew a lot about like source control, to others that weren't very well explained. Maybe it was too dry, or it just didn't interest me. I don't know, but I wouldn't recommend it.

Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury
A classic book from high school literature class that I managed to miss out on. It takes place in a dystopian future where books are illegal and burned. It's not particularly long, so I won't go into much detail, but it's a great read. Some very salient points that are (sadly) relevant today.

Clean Code by Robert C. Martin
 - As an experienced developer, I agreed with quite a lot in the book. It was still worthwhile to read; it crystalized some comments, made me reflect on some of my programming values, and nicely explained several topics. I think I would've gained more by reading this five years ago, but it was still worthwhile. I would recommend it to people who've programmed a few years and are looking to make the next jump.

Republic Lost by Lawrence Lessig
The argument put forth by Lessig is that Campaign Finance Reform is arguably the most important issue facing the United States today. Congressmen spend an inordinate amount of time securing campaign funds from lobbyists which corrupts their ability to represent American citizens. He illustrates several proofs and several examples of this at work including climate change, the obesity epidemic, and several more.. For what it's worth, I think he's right. In the middle of reading I discovered there was an updated version taking into account the recent 2016 election. I read the original which from around 2012. He also shares several solutions to this problem. Anyways, it can be kind of a slow read because I feel like he belabors the point sometimes. But it's a compelling argument and worth reading.

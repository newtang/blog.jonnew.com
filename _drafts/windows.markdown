As an owner of an older house, my wife and I gradually make updates and improvements. We're modestly handy (Liz moreso than me) so we tackle some things ourselves like patching holes, landscaping, or weatherstripping. We contract out bigger projects, and our latest one is new window installation. We live on a busy corner, so we hear everything outside. Most annoyingly we hear conversations of passerbys as if they're in our living room. Although our windows are double paned, they're old, aluminum, and don't latch well. We were looking to shore up our soundproofing, and if we get some energy efficiency improvements, then it's a bonus. I wanted to document some of the things we learned if/when we have to do this again.

### Types of windows
- **Picture Frame**: Window that doesn't open or move.
- **Single hung**: Window is divided into a top and bottom. The top is fixed, but the bottom moves up and down.
- **Double hung**: Like Single hung, but both the top and bottom can move up and down.
- **Casement**: Window that opens like a door by turning a crank.
- **Awning**: Window that opens like a casement, except the hinge is on top.
- **Hopper**: Opens like Awning, except the hinge is at the bottom.

### Window materials
- **Vinyl**: less expensive than wood. Very efficient, and does not require maintenance. Resistant to scratching, fading, and corrosion. This seems to be the standard choice for replacement windows.
- **Wood**: more expensive. Efficient. Requires more maintenance to retain beauty and efficiency. 
- **Aluminum**: Not a great insulator, so it's not great for climates with more extreme temperatures. Allows more light because of the thinner frames. Apparently, they can also be more impact-proof, handy for hurricane areas. [Source](https://www.angieslist.com/articles/pros-and-cons-aluminum-vs-vinyl-windows.htm)

### Features 
- **Paned-ness**: (I made this word up) Double paned windows are literally two panes of glass with a gap between them. Sometimes, it's hard to tell if glass is double paned. One trick is to hold a lighter flame near the window, and see if you see double. You should see a reflection of the flame for every pane of glass. This tip can get a little confusing, because you might see two very slightly offset reflections per pane. Try doing this trick with a glass cup first and you'll start to understand what you're looking for. Oh, and yes, there are triple paned windows. From what I can tell, this might be overkill unless you live near a particularly loud area like a highway.
- **Tempered** is significantly stronger, and will shatter into pebbles instead of sharp shards. Car windshields are tempered. Any installer worth their salt will know where to insist on tempered glass. From my understanding, tempered glass should be used if the window is near the ground, near doors, in doors, in especially large windows, or near anything else that could impact it. The placement of tempered class is usually required by code.
- **Laminated Glass** has a thin, clear, inner vinyl layer. This improves soundproofing, makes the window more impact resistant, and resistant to glass cutters. [Source](http://yourhomesecuritywatch.com/advantages-disadvantages-using-laminated-glass-windows/)
- **Thicker glass**: You can opt to have one of the [panes be thicker to improve soundproofing](http://www.soundproofing101.com/window_pane_thickness.htm). We had one 1/8" pane and one 3/16" pane. 
- **Argon gas**: The gap between the windows is typically filled with argon gas. There are several advantages including [improved efficiency and soundproofing](https://www.thebalance.com/cost-benefits-and-drawbacks-of-argon-gas-windows-844558). 
- **Low-E** is a thin covering over the window that improves energy efficiency and heat transfer. It has a very subtle effect on the color, but it's really not noticable. Aside from this, there's almost no disadvantage from getting the Low-E coating. It [minimizes the amount of ultraviolet and infrared light that can pass through glass with minimal compromise to the visible light spectrum](http://glassed.vitroglazings.com/glasstopics/how_lowe_works.aspx). After installation, we have noticed on hot days it fortunately takes much longer for the house to heat up. For what it's worth, there is also Low-E3 which has improved energy efficiency qualities, but has a much more noticable tint.

### Grids
- Sculptured grids If you're getting grids in your windows, you may have the option of getting fancier sculptured grids. No real benefit other than aesthetics. Since we had laminated windows with thicker glass this wasn't an option.
- Colonial grid divides your windows up into roughly equal rectangles.
- Cottage grid has a row of rectangles at the top of the window.

### Measurements

- **U-factor**: The rate at which a window, door, etc conducts non-solar heat flow. The lower the U-factor, the more energy-efficient the window, door, or skylight.
- **Solar Heat Gain Coefficient**: the fraction of solar radiation admitted through a window
- **Visible transmittance**: (VT): Fraction of visible spectrum the light lets in.

### Other things of note
- **Painting windows**: From my experience vinyl windows come in white, and if you want it a different paint job it'll cost you. We made the mistake of assuming it wouldn't be much of an extra charge, but it turns out it's an expensive, non-trivial process. It actually resulted in a significant delay for our window delivery. If we had to do it all over, I would've asked for an estimate that included paint color ahead of time.

- **Egress**: Many states have an egress code that dictates how much a window must open in a bedroom in order to escape a fire or other emergency. 

- **Installers: A top of the line window installed poorly won't function as a top of the line window.

### TL;DR

We ended up with double paned, laminated, low-e casement and sliding windows with thicker glass and argon gas. Several of the windows are tempered. Admittedly, we didn't get deep into the details of U-factor or SHGC, but the specs seemed fine.

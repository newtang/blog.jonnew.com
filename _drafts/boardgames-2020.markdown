I skipped a year of board game reviews, but they're back!

A bluffing card game, similar to coup, except because exchanges & faked exchanges you don't necessarily know what card you have! This is a good bluffing game for people who don't usually love bluffing games (like me). Some interesting strategies and predictions arise from this one. Relatively quick game.

Baker Street
There's an element of Hanabi in this one because you don't know what's in your own hand. At first glance we thought it would be more challenging, but it turned out to be easier. We tried increasing the difficult and still completed the game without too much trouble. We didn't get a chance to try it on the hardest setting.

Taco vs Burrito
A fun, simple game where you're trying to make the grossest, most outrageous taco/burrito. There's some cards where you can steal other ingredients, and other things to disrupt the game. There's some basic strategy in this one. A fun one to play with kids.

Seven Wonders
This is kind of like Civilization the card game. There are a lot of different ways strategies because of the different card types you can purchase, such a resource, army, science, market, victory points, etc. I'm pretty bad at nailing down a strategy, but fun game! 

Dungeon Mayhem | Dungeons & Dragons Card Game | 2-4 Players, 120 Cards https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GW2195F/ref=cm_sw_r_other_apa_i_M8ujEbR4C3XSD
A fun 2-4 player game that sort of emulates the battle component of D&D. You have hit points, shields cards, attack cards, and special attack cards in each players' shuffled deck. Players can only usually have a few cards in your hand at a time, so there isn't much agonizing over what strategy to choose, and the game moves swiftly. 

Kingdomino
Each player takes turns getting square tiles and building their 5x5 kingdom in front of them. Really clever competitive strategy/puzzle game.

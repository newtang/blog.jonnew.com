A spoiler free review of a boardgame? Yes, that's now A Thingâ„¢. Most boardgames have the expectation of repeated, endless play, at least until you lose all the pieces. These new Legacy games allow for a single run through (which would involve multiple play sessions), where the game is permanantly altered over time by trashing pieces, applying stickers, and adding new elements. By the end, the game is so radically altered that replay is difficult.

Personally, I thought this was an intriguing idea. It allows for a compelling storyline to weave it's way through the game. The single run through seems to turn a lot of people off. It doesn't bother me; how many TV shows, movies, etc have you purchased that you only watched once? Seems similar to me.

The game is based on Pandemic, which is a superb cooperative game where the players work together to cure and eradicate diseases from the board which is a map of the world. Each player has a special ability which adds an interesting strategic wrinkle. Pandemic Legacy starts basically the same way... until all hell breaks loose. The game is divided into 12 months. If you win once or lose twtice, you go to the next month where the story progresses. As a result, you can play between 12 and 24 times. We played about ~20 times including a couple test runs at the beginning to refamiliarize ourselves with the strategy of the original Pandemic. I thought we would be done in six months, but it took nearly a year and a half for our group of four to complete it.

I'll start with some negatives. The rule changes and increased nuance can be difficult to keep in mind, particularly if multiple weeks ellapse between play sessions. Also, my teammates found the defeats to be particularly depressing. Enough so, that continuing to play was seen as a burden. Sometimes the losses happened from impossibly bad luck which only made matter worse. Even though the game evolves, some didn't enjoy repeating essentially the same game.

Personally, I really enjoyed myself, and by the end, I think my teammates did too. It's fun being a part of a team, and I found the storyline and changing game mechanics to be very compelling. The victories were very satisfying, and it was fun to see the new challenges thrown at us, as well as what power ups we could use. If you can commit a group to a regular playing time, I would definitely recommend it.

I've played this a few times over the years, but I wanted to write about it. It's a relatively simple game, with limited strategies. Each player gets several dominoes (each with two sides with numbers 0-12) and you have to get rid of your dominoes on your "train" of dominoes. If you can't, you draw more, and your train becomes public for others to put their dominoes on. It's a pretty straightforward, but fun, chill game. Good for kids. Also, the instructions manage to be a little unclear, but a quick google seach clears it up.<br/><br/><br/>

This is a competitve game where players are trying to build a little city complex by purchasing different building tiles from a shared community market with a few different currencies. You get points by having the most of the different kinds of tiles, and a couple other ways. It's a decent game. It was a little tricky to understand at first, but it's not too complex once you play a couple turns. You can't affect others' progress too much other than buying a tile you think they might want.

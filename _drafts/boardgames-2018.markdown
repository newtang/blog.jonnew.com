I've played this a few times over the years, but I wanted to write about it. It's a relatively simple game, with limited strategies. Each player gets several dominoes (each with two sides with numbers 0-12) and you have to get rid of your dominoes on your "train" of dominoes. If you can't, you draw more, and your train becomes public for others to put their dominoes on. It's a pretty straightforward, but fun, chill game. Good for kids. Also, the instructions manage to be a little unclear, but a quick google seach clears it up.<br/><br/><br/>

## Fiction

#### [![To Be or Not To Be]({{ site.url }}/assets/books-2020/toBeOrNotToBe.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px"}](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0982853742/)[To Be or Not To Be]( https://www.amazon.com/dp/0982853742/) by Ryan North and William Shakespeare
A choose-your-own-adventure book based on Hamlet! It's an amazing permise, and executed brilliantly. It's so easy and fun to go waaay off the rails. And, all the various endings are illustrated by well known comic artists. Very fun book!


#### [![Six Wakes]({{ site.url }}/assets/books-2020/sixWakes.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px"}](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CDDAETS/)[Six Wakes](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CDDAETS/) by Mur Lafferty
A Sci-fi murder mystery...in space! This really drops you in the middle of the action. I really like the world and science in this one. Some of the characters fall a little flat for me, but it's still a great read. High pace, action packed, fun read.

#### [![Mistborn]({{ site.url }}/assets/books-2020/mistborn.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px"}](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0765377136/)[Mistborn](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0765377136/) by Brandon Sanderson
A wonderful fantasy novel. There's a real physics to the magic of the world which is fascinating. There are a few characters who are really well developed, and a few I wish we got to spend some more time with. Great pacing, good surprises, and overall a very fun read.





## Non-fiction

#### [![Open Borders: The Science and Ethics of Immigration]({{ site.url }}/assets/books-2020/openBorders.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px"}](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YRKYKZ3)[Open Borders: The Science and Ethics of Immigration](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YRKYKZ3) by Bryan Caplan and Zach Weinersmith
There aren't too many graphic novels covering complex social-economic policies, so this stands in a category of its own. I loved reading this. The book is conversational in nature, and tries to dissect various arguments against immigration in the United States as well as in favor (and generally comes down strongly in favor). And the illustrations from Weinersmith, the cartoonist behind [Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal](https://www.smbc-comics.com), really help make this a delightful, amusing, and informative read.

#### [![Einstein: His Life and Universe]({{ site.url }}/assets/books-2020/einstein.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px"}](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002AXQX4M)[Einstein: His Life and Universe](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002AXQX4M) by Walter Isaacson
I've read a couple biographies by Isaacson, and he always does a terrific job. He paints a vivid picture; I feel like I'm with Einstein during his breakthroughs and various trials and tribulations throughout his life. It's always interesting to read about the blase parts of historical figures' lifes; they have many of the same struggles that everyone else does.

#### [![Big Business: A Love Letter to an American Anti-Hero]({{ site.url }}/assets/books-2020/bigBusiness.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px"}](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1250110548/)[Big Business: A Love Letter to an American Anti-Hero](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1250110548/) by Tyler Cowen
Lately, business has taken a hit in the public eye. But, Cowen an economist from George Mason, asserts that business does much more good that harm and explains his viewpoints. He agrees that there have occasionally been abuses, but on the whole via employment, and the goods and services businesses provide, are a net positive for society. I definitely found myself nodding along as I read, and although I consider myself generally pro-business, he gave me a few things to think about along the way. Enjoyable, well-written, and easy to read.

#### [![Golden Gates: Fighting for Housing in America]({{ site.url }}/assets/books-2020/goldenGates.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px"}](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0525560211/)[Golden Gates: Fighting for Housing in America](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0525560211/) by Conor Dougherty
San Francisco and the surrounding Bay Area is amidst a housing supply crisis. This book details the origins of this crisis and the resulting YIMBY movement. (Full disclosure, I'm a [YIMBY Action](yimbyaction.org) member.) Dougherty manages to blend captivating human interest stories with government policy history. He also delicately navigates the political minefield of arguments in favor of, and against rent control. Great book, informative, and well written.

## Fiction

#### [![To Be or Not To Be]({{ site.url }}/assets/books-2020/toBeOrNotToBe.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px"}](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0982853742/)[To Be or Not To Be]( https://www.amazon.com/dp/0982853742/) by Ryan North and William Shakespeare
A choose-your-own-adventure book based on Hamlet! It's an amazing permise, and executed brilliantly. It's so easy and fun to go waaay off the rails. And, all the various endings are illustrated by well known comic artists. Very fun book!


#### [![Six Wakes]({{ site.url }}/assets/books-2020/sixWakes.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px"}](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CDDAETS/)[Six Wakes](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CDDAETS/) by Mur Lafferty
A Sci-fi murder mystery...in space! This really drops you in the middle of the action. I really like the world and science in this one. Some of the characters fall a little flat for me, but it's still a great read. High pace, action packed, fun read.

## Non-fiction

#### [![Open Borders: The Science and Ethics of Immigration]({{ site.url }}/assets/books-2020/openBorders.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px"}](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YRKYKZ3)[Open Borders: The Science and Ethics of Immigration](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YRKYKZ3) by Bryan Caplan and Zach Weinersmith
There aren't too many graphic novels covering complex social-economic policies, so this stands in a category of its own. I loved reading this. The book is conversational in nature, and tries to dissect various arguments against immigration as well as in favor. And the illustrations from Weinersmith, the cartoonist behind [Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal](https://www.smbc-comics.com), really help make this a delightful, amusing, and informative read.

#### [![Einstein: His Life and Universe ]({{ site.url }}/assets/books-2020/einstein.jpg){: style="clear:right;margin-left:20px;float:right;width:125px"}](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002AXQX4M)[Einstein: His Life and Universe](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002AXQX4M) by Walter Isaacson
I've read a couple biographies by Isaacson, and he always does a terrific job. He paints a vivid picture; I feel like I'm with Einstein during his breakthroughs and various trials and tribulations throughout his life. It's always interesting to read about the blase parts of historical figures' lifes; they have many of the same struggles that everyone else does.
